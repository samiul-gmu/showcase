console.log(Number('Sample Text')); // This will print NaN as a text cannot be converted to number

console.log(String(23), 23) // Here we convert 23 to its string version

// Type coercion is when an operator is dealing with variables of two different types. JS convert of them automatically
console.log("I'm " + 23 + " years old"); // Here, type coercion is taking place. 23 is getting converted to String

console.log('23' - '10' - 3); // Here, minus sign is triggering type coercion where all the strings are getting converted to numbers.

console.log('23' + '10' + 3); // Here, plus sign does not do similar job as minus sign did above; rather, it concatenate them all assuming they all should be string
