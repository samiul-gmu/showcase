    <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <p>
      Over the course of several years, two convicts form a friendship, seeking
      consolation and, eventually, redemption through basic compassion.

    <h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>
    <p>
      The sole survivor of a pier shoot-out tells the story of how a notorious
      criminal influenced the events that began with five criminals meeting in a
      seemingly random police lineup.
    </p>

    <h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
    <p>
      The history of the United States from the 1950s to the '70s unfolds from
      the perspective of an Alabama man with an IQ of 75, whose only desire is
