    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      With over nine (9) years of experience as an instructor, trainer, and Java
      developer, I possess extensive expertise in backend application
      development using Java, J2EE, Spring, Spring Boot, and Hibernate
      frameworks, incorporating Aspect and Spring AOP concepts. I also possess a
      strong grasp of database management, including SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
      and more. Throughout my career, I have successfully trained individuals
      working on a wide range of projects, from large-scale enterprise-level
      applications to smaller applications suitable for startups or student
      projects. I am well-versed in the MVC framework and proficient in build
      tools like Maven and Gradle. When it comes to problem-solving, I
      prioritize clean, robust, secure, and optimized code. I maintain a strong
      passion and dedication for my work, continually updating my skills and
      knowledge to stay abreast of the latest technologies and tools in the Java
      ecosystem, ensuring that I am equipped to meet modern requirements.
